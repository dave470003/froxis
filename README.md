Attempted last minute submission of project for the 7DRL challenge.
Initially following this tutorial: https://github.com/Bozar/GodotRoguelikeTutorial/wiki/

After that, game will be based on Hoplite - a simple roguelike game on Android. This will prove a good starting point to make an actual roguelike tiny game.

Ideas:
You are in a dungeon. You need to decend 10 floors and beat a boss to win. You start off with a simple sword which can attack nearby enemies. You will gain better upgrades (max one per floor) going downwards. Killing enemies yields nothing but getting them out of the way. Stepping carefully will be key. You start with 3 health which doesn't recover on its own. Enemies will be:
Regular swordsman who has the same abilities as the player at the start.
Archer who can fire arrows across a large distance.
Mage who can cast spells at both long and short range.
Bombers who throw bombs.
